This research explores the critical factors influencing mental health within the technology industry through the use of advanced machine learning methodologies, aiming to predict and identify employees at risk of developing mental health issues. This study addresses a gap in literature, focusing on the tech sector's stress levels which are underexplored in mental health studies. By analysing data from the Open Sourcing Mental Illness Mental Health in Tech Survey from the year 2016, the study employs numerous machine learning models, all of which demonstrated a strong predictive accuracy, with Light Gradient Boosting Machine model proving to have the best accuracy rate based on the evaluation metrics. These outcomes emphasise the potential of machine learning tools in enabling early involvement within organizational settings. The research identifies workplace stress, insufficient social support, and past mental health issues as significant predictors of mental health risks, while also highlighting demographic factors, such as age and gender, with younger employees and women being prone to mental health illnessâ€™ in the technology industry. A key contribution of this study is the development of a clustering based risk indicator that enables the categorization of employees into various mental health risk levels, hence allowing for more targeted and effective interventions. The research acknowledges limitations, including cross-sectional design that restricts the capacity to demonstrate causality and the dependence on self-reported data which may introduce biases. Nonetheless, this study provides a strong foundation for future research and practical applications, recommending approaches like long-term research, the application of the developed models across diverse industries, the integration of objective physiological data, and the design of solutions for specific demographic groups to further advance workplace mental health strategies.
